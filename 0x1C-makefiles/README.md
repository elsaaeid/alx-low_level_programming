# Makefiles

<p>Project done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies at ALX SE School. It aims to learn what are makefiles, when, why and how to use them (with variables, explicit and implicit rules).</p>

<h3>Technologies</h3>
<hr/>

<ul>
    <li>Scripts written in Bash 4.8.4</li>
    <li>C files are compiled using gcc 9.3.0</li>
    <li>Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
    <li>Version of make: GNU Make 4.2.1</li>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>A Makefile is a build automation tool used in software development to automatically compile and build executable programs and libraries from source code. It specifies the dependencies between different files and provides a set of commands to compile and link them together. Makefiles are particularly useful when there are multiple source files with dependencies among them, as they automate the process of compiling and linking the files in the correct order.</p>
